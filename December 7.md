# Design notebook for week ending December 7, 2014

## Description

THis week I wrote up my final writeup (thinking it was due on monday). I also implemented import statements that are recursivley parsed, cycles and repeats are detected and relative paths are used. Tests for that have also been implemented.


## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

No pressing issues. Now I can focus on making a good demo. There are always more features that I'd love to add, but since the demo is coming up I will be just mocking or hard coding some the nicer features just for that.

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

Any feed back ont he writeup would be good. I know it needs some screen shots and diagrams.

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

I spent a bunch of hours, like 10-15. Not really sure. I usually just work on this when I need a break from other things.

## Post-critique summary

I got positive feedback that things were working and it was straightforwards to install.

## Post-critique reflection

It's time to do a feature freeze and just focus on the demo.
